[original](http://www.businessinsider.com/36-life-lessons-from-the-head-of-silicon-valleys-most-important-startup-factory-2015-4)

저는 지난 주에 30살이 되었고, 친구가 지난 10년간 알게 된 교훈들 중에 사람들에게
전할만한 것들이 있는지 묻더군요. 제 답변은 다음과 같습니다:

1) 절대 당신의 가족, 친구들, 혹은 다른 중요한 이들을 당신의 우선순위 리스트에서
아래쪽에 놓지 마세요. 100명의 지인들보다는 몇 안 되는 진정으로 가까운 친구들을
더 높이 사세요. 오랜 친구들과의 연락을 유지하세요. 가끔씩은 아침 해가 떠오를
때까지 사람들과 이야길 나누세요. 그리고 파티를 즐기세요.

2) 삶은 리허설이 아니고 실전입니다. 시간은 극도로 제한되어 있고, 빠르게
지나가죠. 당신을 행복하고 충만하게 만드는 일들을 하길 바랍니다 - 어차피 죽은 뒤
수백년 후에도 기억되는 사람은 몇 없기 마련입니다. 당신을 즐겁게 만들지 않는 일을
하지 마세요(주로 남들이 시킨 일을 할 때 이런 일이 일어나죠). 당신이 별로
좋아하지도 않는 사람들과의 관계를 유지하기 위해 시간을 낭비하지 말고, 부정적인
사람들을 당신의 삶에서 솎아내세요. 부정적인건 굉장히 안 좋습니다. 당신이
하고싶은 것을 하고 있지 않는 것에 대한 핑계들을 자꾸 만들어내지 마세요.

3) 성공의 비결을 알려드리죠: 올바른 할 일을 고르고(이 부분이 굉장히 중요한데
주로 무시되죠), 집중하고, 당신 스스로를 믿고(특히 다른 사람들이 그건 안 될꺼라고
말할 때), 당신을 도울 수 있는 사람들과의 인맥을 형성하고, 재능 있는 사람들을
알아볼 수 있는 안목을 기르고, 열심히 하세요. 무엇에 노력을 쏟을지를 고르는 건
어렵죠. 원래 색다른 생각이란 쉽지 않거든요.

4) On work: it’s difficult to do a great job on work you don’t care about.  And it’s hard to be totally happy/fulfilled in life if you don’t like what you do for your work.  Work very hard—a surprising number of people will be offended that you choose to work hard—but not so hard that the rest of your life passes you by.  Aim to be the best in the world at whatever you do professionally.  Even if you miss, you’ll probably end up in a pretty good place.  Figure out your own productivity system—don’t waste time being unorganized, working at suboptimal times, etc.  Don’t be afraid to take some career risks, especially early on.  Most people pick their career fairly randomly—really think hard about what you like, what fields are going to be successful, and try to talk to people in those fields.
4) 직장에서: 당신이 별로 신경쓰지 않는 일을 훌륭하게 해내기란 어렵습니다. 그리고
당신이 사랑하지 않는 일을 직업으로 가진채로 완전히 행복해지거나 충만해지기는
불가능에 가깝죠. 열심히 일하되, 삶의 나머지 부분들이 그저 흘러가지 않을 수 있게
지나치게 열심히 일하진 마세요. 당신의 전문 분야에서 세계 최고를 노려보세요. 만약
그 목표를 달성하지 못하더라도, 꽤나 괜찮은 곳에 당신을 데려다 줄 겁니다. 당신의
생산성이 어떻게 돌아가는지를 파악하세요 - 멍 때리거나 잘 집중이 안 되는 시간에
일하는 등의 이유로 시간을 낭비하지 마세요.

5) On money: Whether or not money can buy happiness, it can buy freedom, and that’s a big deal.  Also, lack of money is very stressful.  In almost all ways, having enough money so that you don’t stress about paying rent does more to change your wellbeing than having enough money to buy your own jet.  Making money is often more fun than spending it, though I personally have never regretted money I’ve spent on friends, new experiences, saving time, travel, and causes I believe in.

6) Talk to people more.  Read more long content and less tweets.  Watch less TV.  Spend less time on the Internet.

7) Don’t waste time.  Most people waste most of their time, especially in business.

8) Don’t let yourself get pushed around.  As Paul Graham once said to me, “People can become formidable, but it’s hard to predict who”.  (There is a big difference between confident and arrogant.  Aim for the former, obviously.)

9) Have clear goals for yourself every day, every year, and every decade.

10) However, as valuable as planning is, if a great opportunity comes along you should take it.  Don’t be afraid to do something slightly reckless.  One of the benefits of working hard is that good opportunities will come along, but it’s still up to you to jump on them when they do.

11) Go out of your way to be around smart, interesting, ambitious people.  Work for them and hire them (in fact, one of the most satisfying parts of work is forging deep relationships with really good people).  Try to spend time with people who are either among the best in the world at what they do or extremely promising but totally unknown.  It really is true that you become an average of the people you spend the most time with.

12) Minimize your own cognitive load from distracting things that don’t really matter.  It’s hard to overstate how important this is, and how bad most people are at it.  Get rid of distractions in your life.  Develop very strong ways to avoid letting crap you don’t like doing pile up and take your mental cycles, especially in your work life.

13) Keep your personal burn rate low.  This alone will give you a lot of opportunities in life.

14) Summers are the best.

15) Don’t worry so much.  Things in life are rarely as risky as they seem.  Most people are too risk-averse, and so most advice is biased too much towards conservative paths.

16) Ask for what you want.

17) If you think you’re going to regret not doing something, you should probably do it.  Regret is the worst, and most people regret far more things they didn’t do than things they did do.  When in doubt, kiss the boy/girl.

18) Exercise.  Eat well.  Sleep.  Get out into nature with some regularity.

19) Go out of your way to help people.  Few things in life are as satisfying.  Be nice to strangers.  Be nice even when it doesn’t matter.

20) Youth is a really great thing.  Don’t waste it.  In fact, in your 20s, I think it’s ok to take a “Give me financial discipline, but not just yet” attitude.  All the money in the world will never get back time that passed you by.

21) Tell your parents you love them more often.  Go home and visit as often as you can.

22) This too shall pass.

23) Learn voraciously.

24) Do new things often.  This seems to be really important.  Not only does doing new things seem to slow down the perception of time, increase happiness, and keep life interesting, but it seems to prevent people from calcifying in the ways that they think.  Aim to do something big, new, and risky every year in your personal and professional life.

25) Remember how intensely you loved your boyfriend/girlfriend when you were a teenager?  Love him/her that intensely now.  Remember how excited and happy you got about stuff as a kid?  Get that excited and happy now.

26) Don’t screw people and don’t burn bridges.  Pick your battles carefully.

27) Forgive people.

28) Don’t chase status.  Status without substance doesn’t work for long and is unfulfilling.

29) Most things are ok in moderation.  Almost nothing is ok in extreme amounts.

30) Existential angst is part of life.  It is particularly noticeable around major life events or just after major career milestones.  It seems to particularly affect smart, ambitious people.  I think one of the reasons some people work so hard is so they don’t have to spend too much time thinking about this.  Nothing is wrong with you for feeling this way; you are not alone.

31) Be grateful and keep problems in perspective.  Don’t complain too much.  Don’t hate other people’s success (but remember that some people will hate your success, and you have to learn to ignore it).

32) Be a doer, not a talker.

33) Given enough time, it is possible to adjust to almost anything, good or bad.  Humans are remarkable at this.

34) Think for a few seconds before you act.  Think for a few minutes if you’re angry.

35) Don’t judge other people too quickly.  You never know their whole story and why they did or didn’t do something.  Be empathetic.

36) The days are long but the decades are short.
