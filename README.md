# My Translations

## Motivation
There are so many great articles on the internet, but not much of them are
written in Korean. By translating those articles on my own, I can

1. Improve my English skills
2. Get Infos from those articles more thorougly
3. Help some Korean readers who want to read those articles

So, why not start it now?

## Suggestions
You are always welcomed to ask a translation for an article, point out a
mistake, or make a suggestion via [**Issue**
section](https://github.com/heejongahn/my_translations/issues)
